# CloudComputing Project

This repository contains the Cloud Computing's project for the A.Y.2023-2024 (University of Pisa, master degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Engineering), realized by Giovanni Bergami, Marco Bologna and Gabriele Frassi. It is a Map-Reduce implementation of a letter frequency counter, through Hadoop, suitable for large text files.

The project can be executed using the .jar file, with the following command from the target folder
> hadoop jar file.Jar it.unipi.hadoop.Start datasetName output nReducers InMapperCombining

where
- nReducers specifies the number of reducers of the second job. Itâ€™s important to notice that the number of reducers for the first job is always 1, since there is only one key to be reduced.
- InMapperCombining can be 0 (combiner, default value) or 1 (In-Mapper combiner).

The output can be seen with the command:
> hadoop fs -cat output/part-r*

Outputs and informations on results are available in the folder "Output"
